    As a S.T.E.M (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) educator, I value creative thinking almost as much as content mastery. Through hands-on activities, classroom discussion, and even the use of humour, I want students to value their own ability to think creatively, explore their natural curiosity and I encourage them to use novel ways to demonstrate their knowledge.

​

I am strongly committed to regularly assessing students' comfort and engagement in addition to their subject’s mastery. I believe that regular testing of concepts is important, but students also need to feel like confident, resilient learners. I praise students not just for subject’s mastery but also for critical thinking, effort, curiosity, and creativity. I lead by example, always working to improve my own skills in these areas as an educator.

​

Creating a welcoming space for learning is so important, especially for the youngest learners. I am acutely aware that I am defining the session’s experience for my students. I work hard to make that experience a positive and nurturing one.

​

Education is not a one-size-fits-all discipline, and I believe it's essential that my approach is tailored to the specific learning needs of each student. I get to know the students as individuals so I can appropriately support and challenge them intellectually.

​

To date, I have:

Taught more than 2000 hours worth of training sessions.

Taught in more than 50 Preschools, Primary & Secondary Schools.

Taught students between the ages of 4-17 years old.
